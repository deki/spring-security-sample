Your are likely viewing this because you have submitted a forum question or a JIRA and this is a sample project to illustrate points made in my response. You can either run this from the commandline or an IDE that supports Maven (i.e. Spring Tool Suite).

== Running from the commandline

To run the sample application you must have JDK8 installed.
After doing so you can easily run the application using the Spring Boot plugin.
Specifically:

* Navigate to the folder on the commandline
* For Linux execute

	./mvnw spring-boot:run

* For Windows execute

	.\mvnw.bat spring-boot:run

* Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
* You can log in with user/password
* To stop the container use Ctrl-C from the commandline
