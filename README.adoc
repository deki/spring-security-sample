Your are likely viewing this because you have submitted a forum question or a JIRA and this is a sample project to illustrate points made in my response. You can either run this from the commandline or an IDE that supports Maven (i.e. Spring Tool Suite).

== Running from the commandline

To run the sample application you must have Maven 3 installed.
After doing so you can easily run the application using the Spring Boot plugin.
Specifically:

* Navigate to the folder on the commandline
* Execute

	mvn spring-boot:verify

* Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
* You can log in with user/password or admin/password
* To stop the container use Ctrl-C from the commandline


The URL http://localhost:8080/ is visible by either user or admin

The URL http://localhost:8080/admin/ is only allowed for admin
